## mgs-mother-base context

This repository is a MyDigitalSchool project intervening in the context of a mobile/react development course where learning how to use react on an atomic level is the objective

(meaning we utilize the atoms/molecules/organisms/templates way of managing components, [read more about Atomic design patern here](https://medium.com/@janelle.wg/atomic-design-pattern-how-to-structure-your-react-application-2bb4d9ca5f97)).

The project in itself aims to propose a UX in the world of Metal Gear Solid, allowing you as a user to manage your own MotherBase, heavy inspirations coming from MGS: PeaceWalker
